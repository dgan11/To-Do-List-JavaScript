# Javascript TO DO LIST

This is a javascript to do list with a nice and clean UI that automatically sets the date to the current date.

Users can create a new task by typing in the footer and then either clicking the Blue plus sign or pressing the Enter key

Once there is a task, users can mark and unmark a task as complete/not-complete by pressing the circle to the left of the task. When a task is marked as complete the circle will be fully green and the text of the task will have a line through it. 

A user can delete a task from the to do list by clicking the trash icon on the right of the task.

Finally, a user can clear the entire to do list by clicking the refresh button in the top right.
